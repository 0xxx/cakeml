The top-level correctness proofs for the CakeML REPL

inferSoundScript.sml
    Soundness of the type inference algorithm

replCorrectnessScript.sml
    Proof that anything the REPL implementation function does is permitted by
    the semantics.

repl_fun_alt_proofScript.sml
    Proofs for an alternate REPL semantics that maintains extra invariants on the
    bytecode state needed in x86 translation
