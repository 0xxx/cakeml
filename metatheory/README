Theorems about the CakeML semantics.

The *.lem files are specified in Lem source
(http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao/lem/), and the corresponding *Script.sml files
are the HOL source generated from them by Lem.


bigSmallEquivScript.sml
    The equivalence between the big-step and small-step semantics

bigSmallInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about big-step/small-step equivalence.
    Mostly, how to big-step evaluate intermediate small-step states.

evaluateEquationsScript.sml
    Some helper lemmas about the big-step relation.

typeSoundInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about type soundness.  Mostly,
    how to type values and intermediate small-step states, and some
    well-formedness conditions on various type environments.

typeSoundScript.sml
    Type soundness.

typeSysPropsScript.sml
    Some useful lemmas about the type system.

untypedSafetyScript.sml
    Prove that for all programs, including ill-typed ones, the semantics never
    gets stuck, but instead raises Rtype_error.

weakeningScript.sml
    Weakening lemmas used in type soundness
