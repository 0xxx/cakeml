Theorems about the CakeML semantics.

The *.lem files are specified in Lem source
(http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao/lem/), and the corresponding *Script.sml files
are the HOL source generated from them by Lem.


bigBigEquivScript.sml
    The equivalence between the bigStep and altBigStep semantics

bigClockScript.sml
    Various theorems about the clocked big step semantics, and how it relates
    to the unclocked one.  In particular, the unclocked semantics ignores the
    clock and cannot timeout; and the clocked semantics always gets a result
    (exceptional or otherwise) or times out.

bigSmallEquivScript.sml
    The equivalence between the big-step and small-step semantics

bigSmallInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about big-step/small-step equivalence.
    Mostly, how to big-step evaluate intermediate small-step states.

determScript.sml
    Determinism for both the big-step and small-step semantics.

evaluateEquationsScript.sml
    Some helper lemmas about the big-step relation.

metaTerminationScript.sml
    Termination proofs for the recursive functions defined in Lem.

typeSoundInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about type soundness.  Mostly,
    how to type values and intermediate small-step states, and some
    well-formedness conditions on various type environments.

typeSoundScript.sml
    Type soundness.

typeSysPropsScript.sml
    Some useful lemmas about the type system.

untypedSafetyScript.sml
    Prove that for all programs, including ill-typed ones, the semantics never
    gets stuck, but instead raises Rtype_error.

weakeningScript.sml
    Weakening lemmas used in type soundness
