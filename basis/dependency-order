(*
This file records the current, linear dependency order between the
translation/CF theories making up the basis library verification.

This unnatural linear dependency graph is required by the concrete mode
translator (which provides only translation_extends as a method for joining two
translations). Eventually, when we have an abstract mode translator, the
different modules can be made more independent and different combinations can
be selected than simple prefixes of the current ordering.

Note, for example, that TextIO probably needs to inherit Array eventually, so
the ordering below is inadequate. Only minimal functionality is currently
provided (to support existing examples like hello and cat).
