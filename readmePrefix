The CakeML project: https://cakeml.org
======================================

CakeML is a verified implementation of a significant subset of
Standard ML in the [HOL4 theorem prover](http://hol-theorem-prover.org).

We build the CakeML sources using the latest development version of
[HOL4](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL).  We build HOL on
[PolyML 5.6](http://www.polyml.org).  Example build instructions can
be found in [build-instructions.sh].

The `master` branch contains the latest development version of CakeML.
See the `version1` branch for the previous version.
