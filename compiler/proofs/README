replDecsProofScript.sml
  specialisation of the compiler top-level correctness theorem for a setup
  involving a list of declarations to be run from the initial state that define
  the compiler and a function to call it. (these declarations are actually
  defined in ../../translator/repl; the proofs here are generalised.)
