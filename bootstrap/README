compile_repl_decsScript.sml
    Evaluate the compiler on the REPL module.
    Takes around 30 minutes to complete.
    Also, a few other bits of evaluation:
      - the compiler on the bit of code required to call repl_step,
      - prove that the above has no labels, and
      - the free variables of the REPL module.

bootstrap_lemmasScript.sml
    Define the invariant on the bytecode state that includes the bootstrapped
    compiler. Prove that this invariant holds after jumping to the code to call
    repl_step with a new value in the input reference. Also prove that the code
    will run and leave the value of repl_step applied to the input in the
    output reference and the invariant will hold again.
