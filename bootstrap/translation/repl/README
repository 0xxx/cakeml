replMLScript.sml
  Translation from HOL to CakeML of the parser and type inferencer, and, using
  the previous translation of the compiler, of the packaged up REPL function.

replSideScript.sml
  Prove side conditions that the translator generates (mostly that the
  inferencer only uses well-founded substitutions) for the REPL declarations.
  Also proves some EqualityType lemmas that the translator failed on.

replModuleScript.sml
  Packages the declarations produced in replML into a module and inserts three
  extra declarations at the end. Proves some properties about the refinement
  invariants for the repl_step closure

closedReplScript.sml
  Proof that the generated REPL module is closed.

evaluateReplScript.sml
   Prove properties about evaluation (in the operational semantics) of the REPL
   module, and of making a call to call_repl_step.
   Also, define the calls to the compiler that are to be evaluated.
