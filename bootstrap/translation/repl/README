replMLScript.sml
  - translation from HOL to CakeML of the parser and type inferencer, and,
    using the previous translation of the compiler, of the packaged up REPL
    function.

replModuleScript.sml
  - packages the declarations produced by the script above into a module
    and inserts three extra declarations at the end
  - proves some properties about the refinement invariants for the repl_step
    closure

replSideScript.sml
  Prove side conditions that the translator generates (mostly that the
  inferencer only uses well-founded substitutions) for the REPL module.

closedReplScript.sml
  Proof that the generated REPL module is closed.

evaluateReplScript.sml
   Prove properties about evaluation (in the operational semantics) of the REPL
   module, and of making a call to call_repl_step.
   Also, define the calls to the compiler that are to be evaluated.
