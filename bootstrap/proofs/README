  Define the invariant on the bytecode state that includes the bootstrapped
  compiler. Prove that this invariant holds after jumping to the code to call
  repl_step with a new value in the input reference. Also prove that the code
  will run and leave the value of repl_step applied to the input in the
  output reference and the invariant will hold again.
