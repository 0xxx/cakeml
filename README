Directory structure:

- semantics
    The definition of MiniML, including
    - its abstract syntax
    - small step semantics
    - big step semantics
    - a type system
    The definition is expressed in Lem (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/lem),
    but might not work on the released version at any given time, so the 
    generated HOL is also included.

- print_ast
    - a printer for MiniML's AST.

- metatheory
    Proofs about MiniML, including
    - type soundness
    - determinism
    - equivalence of the big and small step semantics

- translator
    A proof-producing translator from HOL functions to MiniML

- translator/okasaki-examples
    15 data structures/algorithms from Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data
    Structures.  The translator is applied to them, and 12 of the 15 are
    verified.

- translator/other-examples
    Example applications of the translator to existing examples, including AES,
    TEA, and RC6 from HOL/examples/Crypto; the probabilistic primality checker
    from examples/miller; and some examples in auxiliary.

- translator/other-examples/auxiliary
    A copying GC, 91 function, regular expression matched and SLR parser
    generator taken from other places, and ollected here for the translator.

- compiler
    The sketchy beginnings of a verified compiler from MiniML to ???

- lexer
    The start of a verified lexer generator.
