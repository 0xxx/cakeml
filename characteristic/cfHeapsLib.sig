  (** Making progress on goals of the form [SEP_IMP H1 H2].

      The main tactic one wants to use faced with such a goal is [hsimpl].

      It will normalize both heaps, extract pure formulÃ¦ ([cond]), extract and
      instantiate existential quantifications from H1 and H2, and remove
      subheaps present both in H1 and H2.

      [hsimpl] is defined using auxiliary tactics, that are also exported here,
      in case one wants to do some more fine grained manipulations.

  (* hpull: extract pure facts and existential quantifications from the left
     heap (H1).

     For example:

      A ?- SEP_IMP (A * cond P) B
     =============================  hpull
          P ==> SEP_IMP A B

      SEP_IMP (SEP_EXISTS x. A x * B) C
     ===================================  hpull
           !x. SEP_IMP (A x * B) C
     
     hpull fails (raises an exception) if it cannot do anything on the goal.
