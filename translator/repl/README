ml_repl_stepScript.sml
  - translate the CakeML compiler from HOL to CakeML

sideScript.sml
  - proves side conditions that the translator generates (mostly that the
    inferencer only uses well-founded substitutions)
  - packages the declarations produced by the script above into a module
    and inserts three extra declarations at the end

oneshotScript.sml
  - declarations for loading the compiler and running it once.
