ml_repl_stepScript.sml
  - translate the CakeML compiler from HOL to CakeML

ml_repl_moduleScript.sml
  - packages the declarations produced by the script above into a module
    and inserts three extra declarations at the end
  - proves some properties about the refinement invariants for the repl_step
    closure

sideScript.sml
  - proves side conditions that the translator generates (mostly that the
    inferencer only uses well-founded substitutions)
