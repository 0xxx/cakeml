Proof-producing translator from HOL functions into CakeML syntax

ml_translatorScript.sml
  - defines the basic predicates (esp. Eval) that the translation will use
  - proves the key lemmas that the translator uses

ml_optimiseScript.sml
  - a simple verified optimiser for CakeML expressions, which is
    applied once the translator has produced some CakeML syntax

ml_translatorLib.sml
  - the translator itself, the main entry point is the translate function

ml_translator_demoScript.sml
  - shows one a simple example what the translator provides

ml_module_demoScript.sml
  - shows one a simple example that the translator can produce a module

mini_preludeLib.sml
  - a minimal common starting point for translations

mini_preludeScript.sml
  - a file that calls runs the lib file above

std_preludeLib.sml
  - a more elaborate prelude for translations to continue from

std_preludeScript.sml
  - a file that calls runs the lib file above

print_astScript.sml
  - defines a function for turning CakeML syntax into concrete syntax

print_astTerminationScript.sml
  - proves termination of the functions in the file above

validate_printerLib.sml
  - functions that test the printer defined in two files above
