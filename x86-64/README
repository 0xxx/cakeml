x86-64 implementation of the CakeML REPL and bytecode

ml_copying_gcScript.sml
  - defines and verifies a copying garbage collector algorithm
  - instantiates the algorithm to the CakeML bytecode
  - proves a number of lemmas about bytecode operations, e.g. Cons and Ref

x64_copying_gcScript.sml
  - produces a verified x86-64 implementation of the above algorithm
    for garbage collection

x64_heapScript.sml
  - based on definition in the two files above, this defines a refinement invariant
    for the CakeML heap invariant for x86-64

x64_heap_basicsScript.sml
  - constructs verified implementations for numerous basic operations, e.g.
    pushing, popping, moving, copying

x64_allocScript.sml
  - constructs verified implementations of primitives for Cons, Ref
    and lemmas for use by the bignum library

x64_bignumScript.sml
  - proves a connection between a library for arbitrary-precision
    integer arithmetic and the CakeML heap invariant

x64_bytecodeScript.sml
  - defines a translation from CakeML bytecode into x86-64 machine
    instructions, and proves that this implementation respects the
    bytecode semantics
