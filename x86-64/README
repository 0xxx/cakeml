x86-64 implementation of the CakeML REPL and bytecode

ml_copying_gcScript.sml
  - defines and verifies a copying garbage collector algorithm
  - instantiates the algorithm to the CakeML bytecode
  - proves a number of lemmas about bytecode operations, e.g. Cons and Ref

x64_copying_gcScript.sml
  - produces a verified x86-64 implementation of the above algorithm
    for garbage collection

x64_heapScript.sml
  - based on definition in the two files above, this defines a refinement invariant
    for the CakeML heap invariant for x86-64
  - constructs verified implementations for numerous basic operations, e.g.
    pushing, popping, moving, copying
  - constructs verified implementations of primitives for Cons, Ref
    and lemmas for use by the bignum library
  - proves a connection between a library for arbitrary-precision
    integer arithmetic and the CakeML heap invariant

removeLabelsReplScript.sml
  proofs by evaluation about the labels appearing in the generated code for the
  REPL module, and definition (and evaluation) of the code with labels removed
  (replaced by concrete addresses).
