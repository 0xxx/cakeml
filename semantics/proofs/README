Theorems about CakeML syntax and semantics

libPropsScript.sml
    Properties of environment lookup

astPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the AST

evalPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the operational semantics

bigClockScript.sml
    Various theorems about the clocked big step semantics, and how it relates
    to the unclocked one.  In particular, the unclocked semantics ignores the
    clock and cannot timeout; and the clocked semantics always gets a result
    (exceptional or otherwise) or times out.

determScript.sml
    Determinism for the big-step semantics.

bigSmallEquivScript.sml
    The equivalence between the big-step and small-step semantics

bigSmallInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about big-step/small-step equivalence.
    Mostly, how to big-step evaluate intermediate small-step states.

cmlPtreeConversionPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the parse-tree conversion functions in
    cmlPtreeConversionScript, in particular totality: that these
    functions will always return an abstract syntax value when given a
    well-formed concrete syntax tree.

evaluateEquationsScript.sml
    Some helper lemmas about the big-step relation.

gramPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the CakeML CFG, including automatically derived
    nullability results for various non-terminals, and results about
    the grammarâ€™s rules finite map.

typeSoundInvariants.lem
    Definitions needed to state the invariants about type soundness.  Mostly,
    how to type values and intermediate small-step states, and some
    well-formedness conditions on various type environments.

typeSoundScript.sml
    Type soundness.

typeSysPropsScript.sml
    Some useful lemmas about the type system.

untypedSafetyScript.sml
    Prove that for all programs, including ill-typed ones, the semantics never
    gets stuck, but instead raises Rtype_error.

weakeningScript.sml
    Weakening lemmas used in type soundness
