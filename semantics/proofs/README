Theorems about basic properties of CakeML

libPropsScript.sml
    Properties of environment lookup

astPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the AST

evalPropsScript.sml
    Properties of the operational semantics

bigClockScript.sml
    Various theorems about the clocked big step semantics, and how it relates
    to the unclocked one.  In particular, the unclocked semantics ignores the
    clock and cannot timeout; and the clocked semantics always gets a result
    (exceptional or otherwise) or times out.

determScript.sml
    Determinism for the big-step semantics.
