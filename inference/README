unifyScript.sml
    Defines a unification algorithm for use in the type inferencer.  Based on
    the triangular unification algorithm in
    HOL/examples/unification/triangular/first-order.  We encode our CakeML
    types into the term structure used there and them bring over those definitions
    and theorems.
