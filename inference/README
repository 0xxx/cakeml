infer_tScript.sml
    Define the type of inferencer types. (Separated out to ease Lem
    dependencies.)

inferScript.sml
    Define a type inference algorithm

unifyScript.sml
    Defines a unification algorithm for use in the type inferencer.  Based on
    the triangular unification algorithm in
    HOL/examples/unification/triangular/first-order.  We encode our CakeML
    types into the term structure used there and them bring over those definitions
    and theorems.

compute_inferenceLib.sml
    Build compsets for evaluating the inferencer in the logic.
