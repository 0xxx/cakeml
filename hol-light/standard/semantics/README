holSemanticsScript.sml
  Define semantics for HOL sequents, in particular the notion of entailment
  i.e. valid sequents, which are those that satisfied by any model of the
  theory context.
holSemanticsExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the semantics.

holSoundnessScript.sml
  Proves soundness of the inference system: any provable sequent is valid.

holConsistencyScript.sml
  Proves consistency of the inference system: the initial context has a model,
  and starting from any context with a model, any context reached by
  non-axiomatic extensions has both provable and unprovable sequents. Soundness
  of the context extension rules is proved here.

holBoolScript.sml
  Define semantics for the Boolean operations and show the definitions are
  correct.

holAxiomsScript.sml
  Prove consistency of each of the axioms. (For the axiom of infinity, this
  requires an additional assumption on the set theory.)
