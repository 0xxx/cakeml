holSyntaxScript.sml
  Defines the HOL inference system.
holSyntaxExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the syntactic functions.

holSemanticsScript.sml
  Define semantics for HOL sequents, in particular the notion of entailment
  i.e. valid sequents, which are those that satisfied by any model of the
  theory context.
holSemanticsExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the semantics.

holSoundnessScript.sml
  Proves soundness of the inference system: any provable sequent is valid.

holConsistencyScript.sml
  Proves consistency of the inference system: the initial context has a model,
  and starting from any context with a model, any context reached by
  non-axiomatic extensions has both provable and unprovable sequents. Soundness
  of the context extension rules is proved here.

holBoolScript.sml
  Defines a mechanism for extending a context by the theory of Booleans
  (connectives and quantifiers), and shows that this is a valid non-axiomatic
  extension. Also defines the intended semantics of the Boolean constants and
  shows that the definitions are correct.

holAxiomsScript.sml
  Defines mechanisms for extending a context with each of the three
  mathematical axioms. Prove that the resulting contexts still have models
  (i.e. these axioms are consistent). (For the axiom of infinity, this requires
  an additional assumption on the set theory.)
