semantics/
  Syntax, semantics, and metatheory (soundness, consistency) for the HOL
  inference system.

monadic/
  Implementation of the HOL Light kernel as monadic functions in HOL (i.e. a
  shallow embedding), and proof that they refine the inference system above.

ml_kernel/
  Implementation of the above monadic functions in (deeply embedded) CakeML,
  generated by proof-producing synthesis.
