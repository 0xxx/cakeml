holSyntaxScript.sml
  Defines the HOL inference system.
holSyntaxExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the syntactic functions.

holSemanticsScript.sml
  Define semantics for HOL sequents, in particular the notion of entailment
  i.e. valid sequents, which are those that satisfied by any model of the
  theory context.
holSemanticsExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the semantics.

holSoundnessScript.sml
  Proves soundness of the inference system: any provable sequent is valid.

holConsistencyScript.sml
  Proves consistency of the inference system: in any context whose axiomatic
  extensions are satisfiable, there exist both provable and unprovable
  sequents. As part of this, need to show that conservative extensions are
  consistency-preserving.
