set-theory/
  Specifies the set-theoretic context in which we will construct our model of
  HOL.

stateless/
  Defines the inference system for stateless HOL and proves soundness and
  consistency.

stateful/
  Defines the inference system for stateful HOL and proves soundness and
  consistency, by translation to stateless.

monadic/
  Defines the HOL light kernel as monadic functions in HOL4, and proves it
  implements the stateful inference system.

ml_kernel/
  Synthesised CakeML implementation of the HOL Light kernel.
