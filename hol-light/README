set-theory/
  Specifies the set-theoretic context in which we will construct our model of
  HOL.

syntax-lib/
  Common helpers used for manipulating (deeply embedded) HOL syntax

stateless/
  Defines the inference system for stateless HOL and proves soundness and
  consistency. Also, defines stateful HOL with semantics by translation to
  stateless, and synthesises a verified CakeML implementation.

stateful/
  Defines the inference system for stateful HOL, gives a direct semantics (i.e.
  ignoring the stateless version), and proves soundness and consistency.

  In this version, the inference system has support for adding new axioms, and
  therefore the three mathematical axioms are not baked in. Also, the semantics
  for new_specification is more correct (in particular, more abstract).

  The remaining directories mirror the stateless development for this system.

monadic/
  Defines the HOL light kernel as monadic functions in HOL4, and proves it
  implements the stateful inference system.

ml_kernel/
  Synthesised CakeML implementation of the HOL Light kernel.
