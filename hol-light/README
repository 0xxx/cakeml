model_syntax.ml
    John Harrison's Model/syntax.ml extended with defns and tweaked to export nicely to OpenTheory.

model_syntax.art
    The result of exporting the above file to OpenTheory, i.e. an OpenTheory article file.

model_syntaxScript.sml
    A HOL4 script file which imports the article file from above into HOL4.

hol_kernelScript.sml
    Defines the HOL light kernel as monadic functions in HOL4.

hol_verificationScript.sml
    Proves that the two files from above agree, i.e. the monadic functions respect the inference rules.

ml_monadScript.sml
    A few lemmas that are used in translating the monadic functions from hol_kernelScript.sml

ml_hol_kernelScript.sml
    Proof-producing translation of all functions from hol_kernelScript.sml into CakeML
