set-theory/
  Specifies the set-theoretic context in which we will construct our model of
  HOL.

syntax-lib/
  Common helpers used for manipulating (deeply embedded) HOL syntax

standard/
  Defines the inference system for HOL, giving a direct semantics (i.e.
  ignoring the stateless version), and proves soundness and consistency.

  In this version, the inference system has support for adding new axioms, and
  therefore the three mathematical axioms are not baked in. Also, the semantics
  for new_specification is more correct (in particular, more abstract).

stateless/
  Defines the inference system for stateless HOL and proves soundness and
  consistency. Also, defines stateful HOL with semantics by translation to
  stateless, and synthesises a verified CakeML implementation.

  N.B. The standard version supersedes the stateless version.
