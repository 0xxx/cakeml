set-theory/
  Specifies the set-theoretic context in which we will construct our model of HOL.

sholSyntaxScript.sml
    Defines the inference system for stateless HOL.
sholSyntaxExtraScript.sml
    Miscellaneous theorems about pieces of the stateless inference system.

psholSemanticsScript.sml
    Defines the semantics of (stateless) HOL, and proves soundness and consistency of the inference system.

holSyntaxScript.sml
    Defines the inference system for stateful HOL.

holSemanticsScript.sml
    Define semantics for stateful HOL by translation to the stateless system.

hol_kernelScript.sml
    Defines the HOL light kernel as monadic functions in HOL4.

hol_verificationScript.sml
    Proves that the monadic functions respect the stateful inference rules.

ml_monadScript.sml
    A few lemmas that are used in translating the monadic functions from hol_kernelScript.sml

ml_hol_kernelScript.sml
    Proof-producing translation of all functions from hol_kernelScript.sml into CakeML
