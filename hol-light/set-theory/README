setSpecScript.sml
  Specification of (roughly) Zermelo's set theory.
  Two main definitions:
    is_set_theory (mem : 'U -> 'U -> bool), and
    is_model (mem, indset, ch)

setModelScript.sml
  An example universe satisfying is_set_theory and (assuming the
  existence of an infinite set) is_model.

jrhSetScript.sml
  A HOL4 port of Model/modelset.ml from the HOL Light distribution.
  Now unused, but was once the set theory behind our semantics.
