  ../monadic/hol_kernelScript.sml

ml_hol_kernelScript.sml
  Proof-producing translation of all functions from
  ../monadic/hol_kernelScript.sml into CakeML

ml_hol_initScript.sml
  Prove that the result of evaluating the kernel module, according to the
  CakeML semantics, satisfies the kernel invariant (STATE) defined in
  ../monadic/holKernelProofScript.sml
