holSemanticsScript.sml
  Define semantics for HOL sequents, in particular the notion of entailment
  i.e. valid sequents, which are those that satisfied by any model of the
  theory context.
holSemanticsExtraScript.sml
  Some lemmas about the semantics.

holSoundnessScript.sml
  Proves soundness of the inference system: any provable sequent is valid.

holExtensionScript.sml
  Proves soundness of the context extension rules: any model of a context can
  be extended to a model of the context obtained by applying one of the
  non-axiomatic context updates.

holBoolScript.sml
  Define semantics for the Boolean operations and show the definitions are
  correct.

holAxiomsScript.sml
  Prove consistency of each of the axioms. (For the axiom of infinity, this
  requires an additional assumption on the set theory.)

holConsistencyScript.sml
  Proves consistency of the inference system: starting from any context with a
  model, any context reached by non-axiomatic extensions has both provable and
  unprovable sequents. And the base case: the HOL contexts (initial context
  with no axioms, with all but infinity axiom, with all three axioms) have
  models (under suitable assumptions).
