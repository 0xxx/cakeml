This directory contains the implementation of the CakeML REPL as a HOL
function.

repl_funScript.sml
    Define the read-eval-print loop

repl_fun_altScript.sml
    Defines an alternate REPL that is better for machine code implementation

repl_computeLib.sml
    Code to set up HOL's evaluation-in-the-logic for the implementation.

repl_compiteScript.sml
    Definitions and theorems that  repl_computeLib.sml uses.

bootstrap:
    Evaluate the compiler on itself in the logic.
    NB, seems to require 32GB of RAM to complete.
