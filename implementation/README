This directory contains the implementation of the CakeML REPL as a HOL
function.

unifyScript.sml
    Defines a unification algorithm for use in the type inferencer.  Based on
    the triangular unification algorithm in
    HOL/examples/unification/triangular/first-order.  We encode our CakeML
    types into the term structure used there and them bring over those definitions
    and theorems.

inferScript.sml
    Define a type inference algorithm

repl_funScript.sml
    Define the read-eval-print loop

repl_fun_altScript.sml
    Defines an alternate REPL that is better for machine code implementation

repl_computeLib.sml
    Code to set up HOL's evaluation-in-the-logic for the implementation.

repl_compiteScript.sml
    Definitions and theorems that  repl_computeLib.sml uses.

test_inference:
    Some tests that type inference accepts some programs using various features.
    
bootstrap:
    Evaluate the compiler on itself in the logic.
    NB, seems to require 32GB of RAM to complete.
